## Contributing.

- Before contributing, ensure you create a branch for a particular feature you'd want to work on, so we wouldn't be having issues of merge conflict
- You can create a branch this way;

```git
        git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

- Make your changes, add them and make your commits

  ```

  git commit -m "your message"
  ```

  Write good commit messages as this is important to know the essence of your commit

- When you're done with your fixes push to that current branch

```git
        git push origin [name-of-branch]
```

- The command above pushes your your commits to the current branch you're in.
- Then make your Pull Request to the dev branch
